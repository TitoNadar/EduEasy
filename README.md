**EasyEdu** is a disruptive app with the amalgamation of most of the top-notch educational apps that provide online courses by acting like a **Trivago for MOOC's**. Over here the app, not only gives you a list view of the best courses offered on various sites but also makes it possible to read about those courses apps, read books related to that topics and also have Stackoverflow in it to solve the doubts. It doesn't end here it also gives us an overview of **"What's happening in the tech world?"** by displaying latest headlines retrieved from **TechCrunch**, Thus Making a one-stop solution to education legally and successfully upscaling the **Education Quality** of the system itself.

### Motivation:
There were various themes like Traffic congestion, traffic Automation, Women Security, Child Safety needed to be quick and it was the need of an hour to use IoT to the utmost level to find a satisfying solution. While we consider other themes like Easy permission System, Convergence of Various Government Schemes requires a security network but the limitations of Second Generation of BlockChain is preventing us which leaves us to Brainstorm in 3 sections that are Blood Donation, Online Guide, and **Education Quality**, while there can be a delayed solution for Online Guide and as there are several apps for blood donations that made us brainstorm ideas about upscaling the **Education Quality** and thus a prototyped product was formed.
